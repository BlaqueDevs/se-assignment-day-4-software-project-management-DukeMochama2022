# Importance   
    1. Prevents Costly Errors – Fixing defects early is cheaper than fixing them after release.
    2. Enhances User Satisfaction – A high-quality product improves user trust and retention.
    3. Ensures Security & Compliance – Protects against vulnerabilities and meets industry standards.
    4. Boosts Maintainability – A well-tested system is easier to update and scale.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
# Project scope
    Prevents Scope Creep – Avoids uncontrolled changes that can increase costs and timelines.
    Sets Clear Objectives – Defines what is in scope and out of scope to align team efforts.
    Improves Resource Allocation – Ensures the right people, time, and budget are assigned.
    Enhances Risk Management – Helps identify risks early and develop mitigation strategies.
    Facilitates Stakeholder Communication – Keeps all team members aligned on project goals.
# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)- is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable tasks. It breaks down the project into phases, deliverables, and work packages.
#Usefulness of WBS
     Improves Planning & Scheduling – Helps define clear tasks and deadlines.
     Enhances Team Coordination – Assigns specific tasks to responsible team members.
     Aids in Cost Estimation – Allows better budget allocation and tracking.
     Facilitates Progress Monitoring – Helps track completion and identify bottlenecks.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
# Benefits of Detailed project schedule
   1. Ensures Timely Completion – Helps set realistic deadlines and avoid delays.
     2.  Improves Resource Allocation – Ensures the right people and tools are available when needed.
      3. Enhances Team Coordination – Keeps everyone aligned on tasks and responsibilities.
      4. Facilitates Progress Tracking – Allows monitoring of milestones and identification of bottlenecks.
      5. Reduces Risks & Uncertainty – Anticipates potential delays and allows for contingency planning.
      6. Helps in Budget Control – Avoids cost overruns by ensuring efficient resource management.
      7. Supports Effective Communication – Keeps stakeholders informed about project timelines.
# Benefits of Gantt Chart
       Visualizes the Project Timeline – Shows start and end dates for each task.
       Clarifies Task Dependencies – Helps identify which tasks must be completed before others can begin.
       Tracks Progress in Real Time – Allows monitoring of completed and pending tasks.
       Improves Resource Management – Ensures tasks are assigned efficiently.
       Facilitates Collaboration – Keeps teams and stakeholders aligned on project goals.
